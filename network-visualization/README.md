The network visualization page also contains the [Left panel](left-panel.md), [Right panel](right-panel.md) and [Network visualization board](network-visualization-board.md). Left panel focuses on the functions related to basic analysis of the network, while Right panel focuses on the advanced analysis functions and modifications of inherent network parameters. Network visualization board provides the interactive operations for users to apply various analysis on the network.
